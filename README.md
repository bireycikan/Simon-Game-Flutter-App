# Simon Game Flutter App

I created simon game in Flutter. You can download and test it.

You can learn how simon game works by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqj76Q4jJ4).

## Issues

`stopSequence()`([click here to go to definition](lib/components/simon.dart)) method was not defined. It will be defined soon. Basically, this method is going to stop sequence after `nextSequence()` method initialized. All sequenced sounds in `nextSequence()` method should be stopped in `stopSequence()` method.
